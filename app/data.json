Your goal is to avoid these hazards and survive for as long as possible. You'll need lightning-fast reflexes to dodge red lanes and barriers. The game's speed escalates every 15 seconds, increasing the survival challenge. Different levels offer more challenges, unlocking after just 30 seconds of survival. All in all, Red Rush is simple yet intensely challenging, potentially pushing some players to their limits."
